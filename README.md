# Mouse-Jiggler-RC-Car-Control-ESP01
Create a "mouse jiggler" by sending commands to an RC Car Receiver Chip (RX2 like)


Here I present how to take a simple RC car and add an ESP-01, a couple of switches and some velcro wire ties to make a "mouse jiggler" to keep your screen, game or sesssion from timing out.  The original function of the car is maintained; a toy operated by the remote control it came with.  In addition, by moving a switch, the esp-01 control takes over.  The esp-01 mimics the rc protocol by sending a series of pulses into the rc cars receiver chip.  This pulse protocol is sent out of the esp-01  -- Work in progress
